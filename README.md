# Snow Lang

`Snow Lang` is a **Toy-Level** programming language write in Go and implemented an interpreter for it.

# Why named 'Snow Lang'?

It' simple and crystal, `Snow` is the homonym of snowflakes in Chinese(`雪花`), and the `雪花` is homophonic for my girlfriend's name in Chinese.

# Can I use `Snow Lang` for production?

Of course not. `Snow Lang` is just toy and I learn the compilers principle through it.

# Roadmap

- [x] Lexing and defining tokens.
- [x] Simple REPL.
- [x] Parsing `let` statements.
- [x] Parsing `return` statements.
